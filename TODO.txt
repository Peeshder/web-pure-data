* pd.receive() - 'callback' receivers which send data outside Pd, like in pd-for-android
* connection fanning - make inlet/outlet holders be arrays
* make [timer] to get the internal Pd timer right

* fix [sel]
* fix [random] and [noise~] (use Pd's algorithm)
* fromString method for constructing patches programmatically
* sample accurate messages - give some messages a timestamp if they are to be executed at a certain time. in objects like [vline~] only execute them at that time
