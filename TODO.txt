* fix [random] and [noise~] (use Pd's algorithm)
* send proximity-to-line code to spencer
* create the metro object as an example for timer objects
* connection fanning - make inlet/outlet holders be arrays
* fromString method for constructing patches programmatically
* sample accurate messages - give some messages a timestamp if they are to be executed at a certain time. in objects like [vline~] only execute them at that time
* 'callback' receivers which send data outside Pd, like in pd-for-android
